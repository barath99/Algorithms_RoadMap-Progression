## Proposing a Change

If you intend to implement a feature, or make a non-trivial change to the current implementation, we recommend [first filing an issue](https://github.com/SpiderNitt/interview-questions/issues/new) marked with the `proposal` tag, so that the engineering team can provide guidance and feedback on the direction of an implementation. This also help ensure that other people aren't also working on the same thing.

Bug fixes are welcome and should come with appropriate test coverage.
