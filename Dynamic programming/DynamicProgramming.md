# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem by breaking it into subproblems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid computing the same results again.

two main property that problems should satisfy, so that it can be solved efficiently by dynamic programming:

- Overlapping Subproblems
- Optimal Substructure

#### Overlapping Subproblems

Subproblems are smaller versions of the original problem. Any problem has overlapping sub-problems if finding its solution involves solving the same subproblem multiple times.

#### Optimal Substructure

Any problem has optimal substructure property if its overall optimal solution can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.
